        <br>
        I come from a small town in regional Victoria with an interest in technology and digital arts. I began my studies at RMIT part-time in 2020 and moved to full time at the beginning of this year after finishing a full-time contract doing some project management work. I'd like to complete my Bachelor of IT so that I am able to pivot into a programming role and have a more stable and steady career path, and hopefully, one day, take on a role with a game development studio so I can use both my technical abilities and creative mind to create things I'm passionate about.

        <h3>Who is the course instructor</h3>
        <p>Trevor</p>

        <h3>Who is your class tutor</h3>
        <p>Also Trevor</p>

        <h3>Have you any programming or web design experience?</h3>

        <p>Self taught Python and C#, Java through Intro to Programming and Programming 1 <br>
        Any web design experience I have comes from Intro To IT where I was resposible for creating the group's web page.</p>

        <h3>Do you see yourself as a programmer, designer, or both?</h3>
        <p>I would say both. I really enjoy programming and I do have a creative side, I have dabbled a fair bit in digital art and 3D modelling as well.</p>

        <h3>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</h3>
        <p>I'd like to complete my Bachelor in IT since I find programming, and technology very interesting. I'd also get to work with my friends afterwards :)</p>

        <h3>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</h3>
        <p>hopefully by the end of this I'd be comfortable enough to build a website for one of my friends. He has his own carpentry business in Camperdown 'Made by Ant'</p>

        <h3>What websites do you use the most?</h3>
        <p>Youtube and Canvas.</p>

        <h3>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</h3>
        <p>As I mentioned before, I've dabbled a bit in drawing, digital art and 3D modelling. I also play guitar, however most of my free time lately is spent either lifting or playing games. I try to enjoy RPGs as much as I can but lately one of my friends has dragged me back into the pits of hell (League of Legends)</p>
